This repository contains both code and data (formal-informal spelling variant pairs) for the purpose of evaluating word embeddings created for social media and informal domains. More details can be found in my paper, ["Evaluating Informal-Domain Word Representations With
UrbanDictionary"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.08270v1.pdf).

Additionally, the UrbanDictionary scraper script may be of use for other projects that rely on UrbanDictionary.
